# House-price-prediction
Currently engaged in a dynamic project focusing on house price prediction, utilizing supervised machine learning regression algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict house prices based on key features, offering valuable insights for both buyers and sellers. Leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I am implementing various regression techniques to train models and generate predictions. This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, enhancing my skills in real-world application of predictive modeling.
